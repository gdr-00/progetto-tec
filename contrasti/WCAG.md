For usability and accessibility, links should be underlined by default. Otherwise, [link text must have at least 3:1 contrast with surrounding body text](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/#only), and must present a non-color indicator (typically underline) on mouse hover and keyboard focus. (abbiamo abbastanza contrasto per non mettere la sottolineatura)

In addition, both links and body text must have at least 4.5:1 contrast with the background (3:1 for large text) to meet WCAG 2 Level AA.
